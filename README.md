# COVID-19-Analysis & Prediction 
## Why We Need Covid Prediction 
• Analyzing and predicting COVID-19 outbreaks is essential for several reasons.

• Firstly, it helps to anticipate and prepare for future waves, enabling proactive measures to minimize
the impact on public health and healthcare systems.

• Secondly, predictive models guide policymakers in making evidence-based decisions on resource
allocation, vaccination strategies, and containment measures.

• Thirdly, analyzing trends and patterns allows for the identification of high-risk areas and populations,
facilitating targeted interventions and support.

• Overall, analysis and prediction are crucial tools in the ongoing fight against COVID-19, allowing for
more effective responses and ultimately saving lives
